## Work Content

- Completed the project initialization.

- Download packages that will be used and learned in the future

- Create a frontend example module

- Learned about monorepos project structure

## Details

Created whole project by using curor and Claude3.5

Claude provide  pnpm commands to create a monorepos project. 

This  type of project structure allows the entire project import packages from a repository in the parent project . This prevents users from downloading packages repeatedly ,and enables  modules to easily import  from within the same project.

With Claude's help, I learned many new Vue technologies and frontend packages , I will study them in depth and implement them  in the future projects.
