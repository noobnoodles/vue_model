# Auth summary

## preface

This summary is for Auth module development , which will state the difficulty and deficiencies in development and design.


## whole process

Before I start my development , I read and search for many knowledge about how to develop a project which can used in many situation.
So I found distribution concept , which is a idea that require every module in system can operation separately.One of the benefit is that make system decouple. Main techique is Spring-cloud (which dosen't apply yet) and monorepo (Font-end's distribution reposerity).

I didn't draw the whole project flow chat and blueprint. I built database immediately . Fortunately Auth database is quite simple , I didn't found some big  fault.

Whole development is guided by cursor and deepseek. However I still learn lot things and concept , I found that I should design better, this will make develop easier . I should learn more by myself and helped by AI.

Maybe next project will have more correct design and better idea.
